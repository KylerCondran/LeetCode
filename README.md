# Accepted LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains all my solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in C#. Each solution includes a numbered title, a link to the problem, tags associated with the problem, and the corresponding C# code that successfully solved the problem. Here is a link to my LeetCode account: [https://leetcode.com/u/KylerCondran/](https://leetcode.com/u/KylerCondran/).

## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular online platform for practicing coding interview questions. It offers a vast array of problems across multiple difficulty levels, covering topics such as algorithms, data structures, and more.

## About This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to challenge myself and provide a resource for learning and understanding different problem-solving techniques in C#. By analyzing and implementing solutions to LeetCode problems, you can improve your problem-solving skills, understand various algorithms and data structures, and prepare for technical interviews. This code base is not perfect and could benefit from further optimization and cleanup, and some of the code I wrote may be downright silly, but each solution was accepted by the LeetCode judging software at the time of publishing.

## Structure

In the project directory, I have a class file for each difficulty level of problems and an extra class file for helper methods. Each difficulty class file has two region tags, methods for individual problems are on top, and stand alone classes for design problems on bottom. The program class file contains the main run method, some dummy data, and helpful notes in case you wanted to run any of the solutions. There are also some folders for non C# related LeetCode categories.
